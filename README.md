# Marketing Campaign Analysis using Python

## Project Overview
This project leverages Python to analyze marketing campaign data, providing valuable insights to improve campaign effectiveness and return on investment (ROI). By utilizing data science techniques, we aim to understand customer behavior, segment audiences, evaluate campaign performance, and predict future trends.

## Detailed Features
1. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing duplicates
   - Standardizing data formats
   - Encoding categorical variables

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Statistical summary of key metrics
   - Visualization of data distributions
   - Correlation analysis between variables
   - Trend analysis over time

3. Customer Segmentation:
   - K-means clustering for audience segmentation
   - RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis
   - Demographic and behavioral profiling

4. Campaign Performance Metrics:
   - Conversion rates
   - Click-through rates (CTR)
   - Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)
   - Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
   - Lifetime Value (LTV) analysis

5. Predictive Modeling:
   - Forecasting future campaign performance
   - Customer churn prediction
   - Next best action recommendations

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.8+
- Data manipulation: pandas, numpy
- Data visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
- Machine learning: scikit-learn
- Statistical analysis: scipy
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/marketing-campaign-analysis.git
   cd marketing-campaign-analysis
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Guide
1. Data Preparation:
   - Place your marketing campaign data in the `data/raw/` directory
   - Run data preprocessing script:
     ```
     python src/preprocess_data.py
     ```

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - Open and run the Jupyter notebook:
     ```
     jupyter notebook notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb
     ```

3. Customer Segmentation:
   - Execute the segmentation script:
     ```
     python src/customer_segmentation.py
     ```

4. Campaign Performance Analysis:
   - Run the performance metrics script:
     ```
     python src/campaign_metrics.py
     ```

5. Predictive Modeling:
   - Train and evaluate models:
     ```
     python src/predictive_models.py
     ```

6. View Results:
   - Check the `results/` directory for output files, visualizations, and reports
